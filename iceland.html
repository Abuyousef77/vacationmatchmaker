    <h1>Iceland</h1>
    <p>You're going to Iceland! A suprisingly green country, remotely located away from the
    hustle and bustle of the modern world. The prices might break the bank but will make up
    for it with it's peaceful tranquility. With a tiny population and ample opportunities
    for eco tourism, you will not be disappointed with your nordic adventure.</p>
