    <h1>Singapore</h1>
    <p>You're going to Singapore! A tiny country, comprised of entirely urban space. It is one
    of most densely populated places in the world and also one of the richest. Taking a river cruise
    comes highly recommended. The best view of this modern city can be seen from the water!</p>
